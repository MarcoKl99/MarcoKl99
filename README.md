***My teck-stack is two fold ❗️***

As I am working in Data Engineering and coming from a Mathematics background, I am highly passionate about Machine Learning, which is mostly done in Python using High-Level frameworks like PyTorch or Scikit-Learn.

Still, besides these incredible frameworks, I love to go back to the basics and develop personal projects using a Low-Level language like C. This helps me understand the basic concepts of programming, taking care of memory management and carefully thinking about stuff like memory ownership and efficiency.

## Projects 🚀

I am currently building up this new GitHub profile, so I am just starting to include projects, more are about to come.

Here is a table of short descriptions about the currently public repositories.

|Name|Tech-Stack|Description|
|---|---|---|
|C-string-lib|C|A String library in C, providing various functions for dynamically handling `char *` and a custom wrapper struct `dstring_t` for memory management, used in a small CLI for populating templates from files and strings|
|cpp-csv-reader|C++|Small Refresher of C++ skills, implements a CSV file reader (parser) and provide a few statictical functionalities like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.|
